## Group Users with Segments and Audiences

**Identify your most valuable customers:**
Segments let you isolate groups like customers who spent over $100 or customers who made repeat purchases. This helps you understand who your best customers are and their behavior -- such as the content or items they view and the items they purchase -- which helps you refine your marketing efforts.

**Find website strengths and weaknesses:**
Segments can reveal which parts of your website perform well for different audiences. For instance, you might see that visitors from social media convert better on product landing pages with eye-catching visuals.

**Tailor marketing campaigns:**
A segment focused on users who came from paid search can reveal how ads impact user behavior on your site. This information can help you refine the add message or landing page to improve conversion rates.

With the segment overlap technique, you can compare up to three user segments to quickly see how those segments overlap and relate to each other. With the aforementioned example in mind, let's see what insights you can draw using this technique.

**Audience:**
In Google Analytics, an audience is a group of users from your site and/or app who share one or more characteristics you define and be created from scratch or from a segment you've already created. For example, audiences may be based on users who've generated similar behavior data or who share demographic or other descriptive data (e.g., same age group, same gender, or were acquired by the same campaign).

**Predictive Audience:**
A predictive audience has at least one condition based on a predictive metric. Analysis generates predictive metrics by modeling the data you collect (if you collect the required minimum amounts of the necessary data) and predicting which of your users will behave a certain way. The predictive models evaluate your data to figure out things like which users are likely to make a purchase, which users are likely to stop using your site and/or app, and how much revenue users are likely to generate.

**Create segments:**
Segments can be created from scratch or based on pre-built suggestions. For example, a segment for users who have previously purchased apparel items from a store can be created by selecting the **Purchaser** pre-built suggestion and adding a condition for item category containing **apparel**.

**Build audiences from segments:**
Segments can be converted into audiences for ad remarketing or bidding purposes. This can only be done by enabling the **Build an audience** option in the segment settings, specifying the membership duration, and saving the audience. Additionally, audiences can be created from selections in Explore reports or from scratch using the audience builder in the admin section.

**Use audience triggers:**
Audience triggers are events that fire each time a user is added to an audience. These triggers can be set up to provide additional insights into user behavior, mark key events, or create conversions for Google Ads optimization.

**Create audiences from explore reports and audience builder:**
Audiences can also be created from selections in explore reports, such as funnel abandonment segments, or from scratch using the audience builder. The audience builder allows for the creation of custom audiences based on specific conditions, such as users who triggered certain events and those who did not.

### Module Questions

**Segment:**
Allows you to analyze groups of users, sessions, or events based on the characteristics you define in Explore.
