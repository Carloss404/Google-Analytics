## Get to Know the Predefined Reports

**Demographics Report:** Age, location, language, gender, interests.
**Google Signals:** Session data from sites, and apps that Google associates with user who have signed into their Google accounts, and have turned on apps personalization.

When device advertising ID is not present, Analytics can't provide all these data, meaning that **Demographics and Interests** data may only be available for a subset of your users, and might not represent all of your traffic.

**Reports Snapshot:** Contains cards providing an overview of various data points and insights.
**Realtime Report:** Displays events that took place within the last 30 minutes.

### Default Reports
**Acquisition:** Where are your customers coming from?
**Engagement:** What content are your customers engaging with?
**Monetization:** What's your customer's shopping activity?
**Retention:** Are your customers coming back?
**User Attributes:** Who are your customers?
**Tech:** What technology are your customers using?

## Filter and Compare Data In Reports

> **All Reports in Google Analytics are made up of Dimensions and Metrics**

> **A metric a quantitative measurement, which you can apply mathematical operations to, like count of, average or percentage**

> **Comparisons enable you to evaluate subsets of your data side by side, e.g., compare data between across different countries, or compare the difference between IOS and Android users**

> **Comparisons remain in effect when switching reports**

> **Report Filters let you control what data is shown in your reports. They can help you understand your data, find trends, and drill into the details you care about. For example, use a report filter to only look at data for users in specific regions while the rest of the data stays hidden.**

> **Dimension values are user when building the rules for a report filter or comparison.**

## Use Explore for Advanced Analysis

**Explorations:** Give you access to data and analytical techniques that aren't available in standard reports, such as funnels and pathing.

> **Explore can help you to do things like: quickly perform ad hoc queries, easily configure and switch between techniques, sort, refine, and drill down into the data.**

### Free Form Template

**Variables:** Gives you access to the dimensions, metrics, and segments that you can use in an exploration.
**Tabs:** Used to configure the whiteboard are on the canvas. You can select the technique, add items from the variables panel, and configure techniques specific options. Also used to compare segments, select breakdowns and values and apply filters.
**Canvas:** Displays all of your data. It can have multiple tabs to use multiple techniques in a single exploration.

### Template Techniques

**Free Form Exploration:** Free form presents data in a cross-tab layout, where you can arrange the rows and columns and add metrics you're most interested in. You can also apply different visualization styles, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps. Can't find the variable you want? Select the **Plus** icon to view the full list of dimensions and metrics available.

**Funnel Exploration:** Funnel explorations lets you visualize the steps your users take toward a key task or conversion. This tool helps you identify sequences of key events and understand how your users navigate these steps. Learn where your users enter your funnels as well as where they drop off.

**Path Exploration:** Path exploration lets you understand how people progress from one stage in the customer journey to the next. Like funnel exploration, path exploration explores the steps users take through your site or app. But while funnels only analyze a single, predefined path, path exploration is free-flowing and can follow any number of undefined paths, even ones you weren't aware of or didn't intend. For example, it could uncover looping behavior, which may indicate users becoming stuck.

**Segment Overlap Exploration:** It shows how different users segment relate to each other. You can use this technique to identify new segments of users who meet complex criteria.

**Cohort Exploration:** It helps you look at the behavior and performance of groups of users related by common attributes.

**User Lifetime Exploration:** Allows you to explore user behavior and value over their lifetime as a customer.
